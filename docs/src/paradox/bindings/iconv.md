# iconv

The [`iconv.h`] binding allows to convert text between different character sets, for example convert text from UTF-8 to ISO-8859-1.

To use this binding add the following resolver and the dependency:

@@binding[iconv]

You also need to configure your build tool to link with the iconv library on macOS.
For sbt, you can use the following code:

@@snip[sbt-iconv](../../../../build.sbt) { #sbt-iconv-linking-options }

## Example

@@snip [iconv](../../../../bindings/iconv/src/test/scala/org/scalanative/bindings/tests/IconvSpec.scala) { #usage-example }
