# Building with `CMake`

Building `scala-native-bindgen` requires the following tools and libraries:

 - [CMake] version 3.9 or higher
 - [GNU Make]
 - [LLVM] and [Clang] version 5.0 or 6.0.
 - [nlohmann/json] version 3.1.2 or higher

```sh
# On apt-based systems
apt install cmake make clang-6.0 libclang-6.0-dev llvm-6.0-dev \
            nlohmann-json-dev

# With `brew`
brew tap nlohmann/json
brew install cmake llvm@6 nlohmann_json
```

To run the tests you also need the required Scala Native libraries.
See the [Scala Native setup guide] for instructions on installing the dependencies.

```sh
mkdir -p bindgen/target
cd bindgen/target
cmake ..
make
./scala-native-bindgen --name ctype /usr/include/ctype.h --
```

To build a statically linked executable pass `-DSTATIC_LINKING=ON` when invoking `cmake`:

```sh
cmake -DSTATIC_LINKING=ON ..
```

Additional compiler and linker flags may be passed as environment variable sor their CMake
equivalent, e.g. to compile with debug symbols the following are the same:

```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-g ..
CXXFLAGS=-g cmake ..
```

## Testing

The tests assume that the above instructions for building `scala-native-bindgen` from source
has been followed.

```sh
cd tests
sbt test
```
